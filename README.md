# TutorLink

TutorLink is a simple MERN stack web application that connects **students** and **tutors** in one platform.  
It allows tutors to upload courses, and students can explore, request, and enroll in them.



#Why I Built This Project

Many students struggle to find the right tutors or courses, and tutors face difficulty reaching students.  
TutorLink solves this by creating a **bridge** between students and tutors ‚Äî making the learning process smooth, transparent, and efficient.


##  Problem Statement

There‚Äôs no simple system that allows students to:
- Browse all available courses easily  
- Connect directly with tutors  
- Manage enrollments and approved classes  

Tutors also need a better way to:
- Upload and manage their courses  
- Handle enrollment requests  
- Approve or reject students quickly  

TutorLink solves all these issues in one place.
